//write a function to age and return the year you were born using psuedocode.
//solution: define the function thus:
function birth_year(currrent_year, age) {
//hence, summon or invoke the current_year and input age respectively and, compute
//the birth year as follows:
  let birth_year = currrent_year - age;
  //therfore,
  console.log(birth_year);
};
//given 2024, as the current_year whilst 30 as the age, hence:
birth_year(2024, 30);
//conclusively, 1994 is therefore the birthyear.
